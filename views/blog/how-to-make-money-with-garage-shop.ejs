        <p>
            I want to give some information on how garage/hobby machine shops can make money.
            Manufacturing is going overseas and many people think that is making it harder and 
            harder to make money with a <a href="http://www.tormach.com/product_pcnc_main.html" target="_blank">Tormach,</a> Bridgeport or other smaller machine in your 
            garage. This is simply not the case and I would argue that there is even more 
            opportunity for the garage shop to make money in this day in age. 
        </p>
        <p>
            With machines like the Tormach it is getting more and more affordable to have a powerful 
            garage machines capable of running small production runs. Machines such as Tormach's 
            PCNC 1100 "Part Maker" Package (includes ATC) make it possible to run precision parts on 
            a production level in your garage. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Making money with your garage shop is all about making the right relationships. When I 
            was making money with my 2 horse CNC Bridgeport Mill I found that walking through industrial 
            parks and introducing myself to companies like mechanical contractors worked great. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Talking to the business owner or even the receptionist about your capabilities and pricing 
            and leaving a business card was all it took. When that company would have small jobs they 
            would want to throw them to me. Completing a couple small jobs for a company builds your 
            reputation for bigger jobs. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes it would take a company that got in a pinch and needed machining done. They 
            would remember that I stopped in and give me a call. Even with the Internet going in 
            face to face helps build relationships that can turn into small production run work. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you get the work make sure you treat it like a business. Keep track of the tooling 
            that you use for the job, keep track of your hours and materials and make sure your 
            process is efficient. One of the most important things to remember as a small machine
            shop is the importance of “Under promising and over delivering on jobs”. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Your reputation as a garage shop is one of the most important things that you have,, 
            for getting and keeping sustainable work. In this day in age with the ability to get 
            into production machining on any budget with companies like Tormach and ToolingInventory.com, 
            why wait? Start making money with your garage machine shop today!
